# Portfolio
This folder contains mini-games that I built in order to learn Javascript (and refresh my PHP/SQL knowledge as well).
If you want to try them out, you can use the following links:  
Tetris : http://emilienpluvinage.com/tetris/tetris.html.  
Minesweeper : http://emilienpluvinage.com/minesweeper/minesweeper.html.  
TicTacToe (2 Players required) : http://emilienpluvinage.com/TicTacToe/tictactoe.html (it's a 2-players game, so if you're on your own you're gonna need to open a second tab and play against yourself)
Water Color Sort Solver : http://emilienpluvinage.com/Water%20Color%20Sort%20Solver/wcss.html (not a game but a solver for the popular game Water Sort)
