# Portfolio
This folder contains small projects that I built in order to learn Javascript (and refresh my PHP/SQL knowledge as well).
If you want to try them out, you can use the following links:  
Tetris : http://emilienpluvinage.com/tetris   
Minesweeper : http://emilienpluvinage.com/minesweeper/minesweeper.html.   
TicTacToe (2 Players required) : http://emilienpluvinage.com/tictactoe (it's a 2-players game, so if you're on your own you're gonna need to open a second tab and play against yourself).   
Water Color Sort Solver : http://emilienpluvinage.com/wcss (not a game but a solver for the popular game Water Sort).   
Till App (built with ReactJS and MongoDB) : http://emilienpluvinage.com/till.
